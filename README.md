# Detecting_Arthritis_X-Ray_Images

<hr>

This project is geared towards training various models using an AI-generated image dataset of Osteoarthritis. We aim to evaluate model accuracy by testing them against a real-world X-ray dataset of Osteoarthritis. Through this comparative analysis, we intend to gauge the precision of AI-generated Arthritis X-ray images in comparison to authentic X-ray data, furthering our understanding of their fidelity and potential applications in improving healthcare for individuals with arthritis.
